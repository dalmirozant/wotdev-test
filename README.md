# WotdevTest

## Disclaimers:

The API doesn't have a search param so I created a client side filter on each page.

Because of the simplicity of this project I decided to put the filter input directly in the people page instead of creating a separated component to avoid unnecesary complications

I didn't create unit testings because of the near deadline
