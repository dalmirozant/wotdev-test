# WotdevTest

This is a small Angular app built as a skills test.
It consumes the swapi.tech api

## Disclaimers:

The **swapi.tech API** returns **different response shapes** depending on the type of request.  
This has a direct impact on how pagination and filtering are handled in the application.

- The filtered list is different to the paginated list. Also the filtered list doesn't have pagination fields.
